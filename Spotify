For this project, I used Spotify data found on Kaggle.
I then created a table to insert Spotify data into.
Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 
Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

Next, I explored the data to determine which artist in the dataset would 
be the best to play at a party based on their average danceability.

Finally, I created a CTE to find average popularity for artists, then labeled those with average
popularities above 90 as "Top Stars"


Creating the table: 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

Which artist has the highest average danceability?  
SELECT artist_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.SPOTIFYDATA
GROUP BY  danceability
ORDER BY  danceability DESC
LIMIT 1;

What is the average popularity for the artists? 
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT artist_name,
AVG(popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData 
GROUP BY artist_name
)
 
SELECT  artist_name,
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
